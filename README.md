# Horiseon-Site-Update
First Challenge to Update Existing Mock Website

## Purpose
I want to update this website to contain accessibility standards and be better optimized for search engines.

## Desciption
1. HTML code should contain semantic elements for my CSS selectors.
2. Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
3. Webpage meets accessibility standards.
4. The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
5. I find accessible alt attributes when viewing the icon and image elements.
6. The title is concise and descriptive.
